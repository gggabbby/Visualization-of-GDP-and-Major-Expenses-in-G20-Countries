## Data Source 

[World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)

The original data sets of this individual project are all taken from World Bank Open Data, using five data sets: GDP (current US$), GDP per capita (current US$) Current health expenditure (% of GDP), Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP) and Military expenditure (% of GDP). 

## Visualization of Specific Content

- The educational, healthcare, and military spending of at least the top 10 nations.
- Compare the spending data to that country’s GDP.
- Compare the education and health to the overall military spending of the country.
- Compare the per person educational spending to the per person GDP.
- Compare the per person healthcare spending to the per person GDP.
- Compare the per person military spending to the per person GDP.
- Fastest growing countries in healthcare and educational spending in fixed value and in percentage.
- Identify any interesting and useful relationships and trends.

## Conclution

According to the analysis and research of this individual project, it can be found that from 2011 to 2017, each country’s education, medical and military expenditures accounted for no more than 30% of the country’s GDP. Among these three items, health medical expenses are the largest. The top three in total gdp are the United States, the European Union and China. The top three countries with GDP per capita are Australia, the United States and Canada. In terms of medical care, expenditures in each country tend to stabilize and rise slowly. In terms of education, all countries are increasing expenditure year by year, and there is a clear upward trend. Based on the data of these 7 years, it can be inferred that in the next few years, the expenditure on health and medical care in various countries will also tend to stabilize, and the expenditure on education will continue to rise gradually. This shows that with the progress of the times and the development of science and technology, peoples’ health have improved and they are all pursuing higher education.
